            <li> 1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <LI>3/4 cup cocoa powder</LI>
            <li> 1 1/2 tssp baking powder</li>
            <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
            <li> 2 eggs </li>
           <li> 1 cup milk </li>
          <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>

          <li>1 cup boiling water</li>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
            </LI>
        
            <LI>Grease and line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.</LI>
            <LI>Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</LI>
            <LI>Add wet ingredients: Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and mix with an electric mixer on medium speed for about two minutes, until smooth.</LI>
            <LI>Add boiling water: Reduce the mixer speed to low and slowly add the boiling water. The batter will be very thin—this is normal.
</LI>
<LI>Bake the cakes: Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</LI>
<LI>Cool: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. </LI>
